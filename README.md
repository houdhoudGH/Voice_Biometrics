#  Voice Biometrics  
**Unlocking Identity Through the Power of Speech**

##  Description
This project explores voice biometrics with a focus on **speaker verification** using classical statistical methods like **i-vectors** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**. The goal is to build a system that can verify a person's identity based on their voice.

##  Project Structure
- **Training phase**: MFCC extraction, UBM training, T-matrix creation
- **Testing phase**: I-vector generation, speaker classification using Random Forest
- **Datasets**: Common Voice (train), VoxCeleb (test)

## Results
The model results highlight the challenges of limited data and high computational cost.

## Techniques Used
- MFCCs for feature extraction  
- GMM-UBM modeling  
- I-Vector + T-Matrix projection  
- Random Forest classification  
- PLDA (optional) for scoring
